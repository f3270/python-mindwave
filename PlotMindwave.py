'''
This program uses Mindwave object to connect using bluetott to Mindwave
and to get the raw eeg signals from the device.

It also plot the signal using matplotlib.

The data is also dumped into a file, but keep in mind that the capture of data
from python can be slower than the driver and the effective sampling frequency if you 
are also plotting the data, could be much lower.

USE ME WITH CV ENVIRONMENT
